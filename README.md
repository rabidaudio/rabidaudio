# Projects

## On-going development

- [Custom Eurorack synthesizer modules](https://github.com/rabidaudio/synthesizer). See [my blog](https://rabid.audio/projects/synth) for details.
- [Guitar and bass stompboxes](https://github.com/rabidaudio/effects)
- an open-source ["modern data stack" pipeline](https://github.com/rabidaudio/selfdata) collecting and reporting on my personal life and habits
- [a VST software synth](https://github.com/rabidaudio/gameboy-synth) wrapping the GameBoy APU
- [a web IDE for annotating chess games](https://github.com/rabidaudio/pgn-ide)
- [an LED wall clock](https://github.com/rabidaudio/led-clock)

## Ideas

If only I could find the time...

- [Torres](https://github.com/rabidaudio/Torres), a modern programming language for embeded platforms. Still in the language design stage
- [wise](https://github.com/rabidaudio/wise) An alternative cli for `git` which is easier for beginners to learn and use
- [an app](https://github.com/rabidaudio/filter-calculator) to assist in analog filter design
- [chrt](https://github.com/rabidaudio/chrt), a command-line tool for graphing data from stdin
- [a mobile app](https://github.com/rabidaudio/travelunits) for easy unit conversions while traveling
- [a wearable metronome](https://github.com/rabidaudio/haptic-metronome) that vibrates to aid in practicing
- [a VST plugin](https://github.com/rabidaudio/soft-focus) recreating the "soft focus" preset of the Yamaha FX500 (a shoegaze sound popularized by Slowdive)
- [an SMD reflow oven](https://github.com/rabidaudio/reflow-oven) from an air frier


## Complete (or close) and actively maintained

- [swank](https://github.com/rabidaudio/swank) - simple command line tool for serving HTTP from a local directory
- [Simple Schema Serializers](https://github.com/fixdauto/simple_schema_serializers), a Ruby DSL for declaring JSON output schemas, faster and more featured than ActiveModelSerializers
- Several [Singer taps](https://hub.meltano.com/singer/spec/):
  - [tap-lastfm](https://github.com/rabidaudio/tap-lastfm)
  - [tap-lichess](https://github.com/rabidaudio/tap-lichess)
  - [tap-newrelic](https://github.com/fixdauto/tap-newrelic)
- [a surface-mount Arduino clone board](https://github.com/rabidaudio/bareduino) for testing my reflow oven
- [a module](https://github.com/rabidaudio/clock2midi) for converting CV clock signals to MIDI clocks
- [a mod](https://github.com/rabidaudio/niftykeyz-jackboard-mini) for the [NiftyKeyz modular keyboard](https://www.cre8audio.com/niftykeyz) to shrink the output board
- [logic](https://github.com/rabidaudio/midi-voicesteal) for voice-stealing a limited number of MIDI channels for a MIDI-to-CV module

## Analysis / Experiments

- [an analysis](https://github.com/rabidaudio/pwd) of brute-forcing zip file passwords in Go
- [an analysis](https://github.com/rabidaudio/alphabetical-words) of all the words in the English language whose letters are in alphabetical order, such as "almost". The longest is a tie between "billowy" and "beefily".
- [a proof by brute force](https://github.com/rabidaudio/10958-problem) of the [10958 problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1479)
